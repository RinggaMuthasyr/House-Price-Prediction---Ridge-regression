How to use Ridge Regression in prediction and how to get the best model on Ridge Regression

## What is Ridge regression?
Ridge regression is the method used for the analysis of multicollinearity in multiple regression data. It is most suitable when a data set contains a higher number of predictor variables than the number of observations. The second-best scenario is when multicollinearity is experienced in a set.

## Why do we need to study Ridge Regression?
- It protects the model from overfitting.
- It does not need unbiased estimators.
- There is only enough bias to make the estimates reasonably reliable approximations to the true population values.
- It performs well when there is a large multivariate data with the number of predictors (p) larger than the number of observations (n).
- The ridge estimator is very effective when it comes to improving the least-squares estimate in situations where there is multicollinearity.
- Model complexity is reduced.
