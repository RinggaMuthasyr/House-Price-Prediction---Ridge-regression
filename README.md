How to use Ridge Regression in prediction and how to get the best model on Ridge Regression

## What is Ridge regression?
Ridge regression is the method used for the analysis of multicollinearity in multiple regression data. It is most suitable when a data set contains a higher number of predictor variables than the number of observations. The second-best scenario is when multicollinearity is experienced in a set.

## why do we need to study Ridge Regression?
Although this model is relatively simple, this model can be an option to create a baseline in Machine Learning modeling which can then be compared with other models to get the best performance.
